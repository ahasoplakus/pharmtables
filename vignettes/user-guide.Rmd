# Setup Filters {#setup}

## Subject-Level Filters

- Expand the **ADSL** navigation pill under **Domain Specific Filters** and select the name(s) of **ADSL** variables from the dropdown to enable subject-level filtering of all tables across <b>all domains</b>. By default *SEX*, *RACE*, *ETHNIC*, *AGE*, *SITEID* and *USUBJID* variables are chosen (At least one needs to be selected).

- **ADSL** filters appears at the left sidebar of the app, under **Population Flags** filter.

```
</div>

## Domain Specific Filters

- Expand the navigation pills corresponding to each domain (ADAE, ADVS etc) and select the name(s) of domain specific variables to be added as filters. Here is an example for **ADAE** specific filters, where **AESEV** and **AEACN** have been added as filters for all **ADAE** related reports.

<br>

- Reload the app and check the selected variables from **ADAE** appear as filters over the **Table Display Options** within the filter box for all **ADAE** related reports. (Click on the `r shiny::icon("table-cells")` icon to access the filter box)
